# Concepts

The Nature System focus on data and relations between them. 

There are two kind of data: `meta` and `instance`. 

## Business Metadata

Business-Metadata is used to represent what the business is and how to used it.

## Business Instances

## Relation

Like 7 Layers of the OSI Model, we must put a problem into a layer, 
I named it here `Thing`.
It let you to shrink it's range and make it easy to study, this is why I call it `Thing` but not layer.
A `Thing` may have many points and `Relation` may exits between points.
The `Thing` and point are __Static__, once they are created they can't be changed.

Relative to `Thing` and point, `Relation` is __Instantaneous__, either it happened or it has not.
so relationships are very time-dependentï¼Œ`Relation`'s can change over time.
Maybe __Event__ is a good word to express the meaning. but event has a random meaning,
yet relationships emphasize specific behaviors of specific participants,
so I choice `Relation`

Let me say more about `Thing` and point. 
A `Thing`may have points, and points maybe another `Thing` for sublayer points.
So point and `Thing` are conceptually equivalent.
I think `Thing` feel more meaningful than point. so I use `Thing` to express `Thing` and or point.

An amazing thing is that `Thing` contains __Hierarchy__. 
The benefit of this is simplify Nature and give freedom management ability to human. 
`Nature` don't care of __Hierarchy__ but need to identify every `Thing`, 
this is a easy way to satisfy `Nature` and human management simultaneously.

`Thing` is only a define, at run-time you must bind an `Instance` to `Thing`.
If a `Relation` exists between two `Thing`'s, 
`Nature` will give upstream `Instasnce` to a converter which is binding to the certain `Relation` and it is at anywhere outside the `Nature`.
Then the converter generate new `Instance`s for the downstream `Thing`.
    
Here the `Relation` made a great job: It locked the __Geographic and Time Coordinates__, 
they are important for `Natrue` to retry when failed the execution.

Converter is just one simple function, and the converter achieve __only one__ goal for the `Nature`.
Converter do no need to know all the other goals in `Nature`,
`Nature` will take care of them by call the converters recursively.

It is very easy to organize the goals in `Nature`.
There is no __Flow Control__, so there is no  __loop__, no __if__ to use to do __Business Process orchestration__ in `Nature`.

down-thing to __select__ upper-thing but not upper-thing to __control__ down-things.
because direct upper-things are more less down-things and __control__ will more complex than __select__..
This mechanism greatly simplifies the process.

Another key point is `Instance` bind to `Relation` but not to a __technical__ `Interface`.
It's purl business dependence,it has nothing to do with technology.
Then `Relation` made a __very short process__, only one step,
but the __simple relation__ can form any complex and large network.

There are good news for developers too, __short process__ will be easy to develop, 
and `Nature` try to run the __short process__ in parallel.

`Nature` only insert `Instance` to db, no __deletion__ no __update__.
`Nature` use __state version__ to express any chang on an `instance` and not all `Thing` have states.
This feature let `Nature` run converter equally for any times, tt is __idempotent__.
